## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, ContextAPI, SASS Modules

**ContextAPI**- for State managment\
**next-pwa** - for time manipulation\
**sass modules** - so sass classes won't mixup and names can be reused\
**react-icons** - for various icons\
**tailwindcss** - for css utilities and JIT compiler

## Lessons Learned

- I started this project to learn about nextjs and generatic static and server side pages with it.
- NextJS is a framework based on react that enables us to create server side rendering application or static pages or hybrid app like this one
- There are mainly two type of Applications develped by Next :- \
    **Static Generation (Recommended)**: The HTML is generated at build time and will be reused on each request. \
    **Server-side Rendering**: The HTML is generated on each request.

- Since Next is based on React, the whole concept of React is applied here from components to states or props, except for routing which is provided by Next
- The main difference in Next vs CRA is 3 different functions which can be declared in components
- **getStaticProps** - If you have external data fetch that data in ths function. This function gets called at build time and lets you pass fetched data to the page's props on pre-render.
- **getServerSideProps** - The HTML is generated on each request. Because Server-side Rendering results in slower performance than Static Generation, use this only if absolutely necessary.
- **getStaticPaths** - uses dynamic routes, Next.js will statically pre-render all the paths specified
- **useEffect** - lifecycle that runs every time there is a change
